# College Lab Work: Arrays in C++

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions and experiments related to arrays in C++. Arrays are fundamental data structures used for storing and manipulating a collection of elements of the same type. In this lab work, we explore various concepts and techniques related to arrays in C++.

## Assignment
Write complete C++ programs that fulfill the requirements of the problems below.
1. Read the entries of an array of 5 integers from a user. Next, loop through the
array and print the odd numbers and then print the even numbers. Finally, print
the sum of all the numbers entered.

2. Initialize an integer array of size 10 with random numbers between 1 and 20
(inclusive). Print the array, then loop through the array adding 2 to every number.
Print the updated array.
